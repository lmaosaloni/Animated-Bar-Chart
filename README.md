## Animated Bar Chart
The Animated Bar Chart project is a C++ program designed to visualize the evolution of categorical data over time through dynamic bar charts. This visualization technique is particularly popular on social media for its straightforward yet compelling way to narrate changes and trends in data across various categories. It can be applied to a wide range of data types, from population growth in cities to changes in market share among competitors, making complex data easily understandable at a glance.

## Why It's Interesting
Animated bar charts bring data to life, allowing viewers to watch as rankings shift over time. This dynamic presentation can reveal patterns and trends that static charts cannot, making it an invaluable tool for storytelling in data journalism, education, and business analytics.

## Applications
# Data Journalism: Illustrating shifts in social and economic indicators.

# Usage Examples

- Preparing Your Data File
The program reads data from a text file formatted as follows:

The first line contains the chart title.
The second line contains the x-axis label.
The third line is the source of the data.
Subsequent sections start with a year or category and are followed by entries representing individual bars in the chart. Each entry is on a new line, with fields separated by commas. For example: Year,Name,Value,Category
